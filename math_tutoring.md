# Unlock Your Child's Potential with Personalized Math Tutoring
  
Are you seeking a math tutor who truly understands the unique  
challenges of ADHD and learning differences? Look no further!  
  
As someone who has personally navigated the complexities of ADHD and  
learning differences throughout my life, I know firsthand how  
traditional teaching methods can fall short. Despite being highly  
intelligent, I struggled with math and subjects requiring specific  
types of thinking. It wasn't until I found a specialized coach who  
understood my needs and helped me strengthen my weak link skills that I began to excel. I graduated with a Bachelors in math from the University of Washington as a result.  
  
Now, with years of experience in the tech industry and a strong  
background in mathematics, I'm dedicated to giving back. I offer  
personalized math tutoring that goes beyond the numbers:  
  
- **Individualized Learning Plans**: I take the time to understand  
each student's unique strengths and challenges, tailoring their tutoring sessions to meet their specific needs.  
- **Executive Skills Strengthening**: Alongside math tutoring, I help  
students develop the executive functioning skills that have been holding them back from doing well in math, fostering  long-term academic success
- **Continuous Support**: Students can reach out between sessions via text if they get stuck, ensuring they never feel overwhelmed or left behind.
- **Collaborative Approach**: If it’s appropriate and my tutoring client agrees, I can collaborate with the student’s parents and, when appropriate, their teachers, to help everyone be on the same page regarding  what strategies and skills strengthening seem to work best for the student to learn best.  I believe in committing to regular sessions to build momentum to allow the brain to develop new neural pathways. My approach isn't  about quick fixes—it's about fostering solid mastery of math principles and how they learn best so their progress last over several  
months.

personal growth, preparing students for future success.
