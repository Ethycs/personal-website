## Introduction
This is my personal site. I plan on using Jekyll and Github actions in order to publish it.
Due to github pages not being allowed to be private I will attmpt working around it using a private submodule.
The need to have a private repository comes from the need to remove machine readable PII from public facing stores. 


## Configuring Jekyll in your GitHub Pages site
You can configure most Jekyll settings, such as your site's theme and plugins, by editing your _config.yml file. For more information, see "Configuration" in the Jekyll documentation.

Some configuration settings cannot be changed for GitHub Pages sites.
